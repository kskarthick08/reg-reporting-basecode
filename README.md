# Reg Reporting AI Platform

Reg Reporting AI Platform is a local-first regulatory reporting workbench that augments three personas with AI agents:
- Regulatory Business Analyst (BA)
- Data Engineer / Developer
- Regulatory QA Reviewer

The platform supports artifact ingestion, gap analysis, SQL generation, XML generation, XSD validation, PSD version comparison, and context-aware assistant chat.
